# Shark Explorer Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the Ergo blockchain explorer with monitoring, API improvements, and new features. The plan is divided into phases with specific tasks and deliverables.

## Phase 1: Monitoring Setup

### Tasks

- [x] Add Prometheus and Grafana services to docker-compose.yml
- [x] Configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from PostgreSQL, Redis, and API services
- [x] Add PostgreSQL and Redis exporters for Prometheus
- [x] Create dashboard for indexing progress
- [x] Create dashboard for database performance
- [x] Create dashboard for API performance
- [x] Create dashboard for token holders
- [x] Set up alerts for critical metrics (e.g., indexing falling behind, high API latency)
- [x] Add custom metrics to indexer service
- [x] Add custom metrics to API service

### Deliverables

- [x] Complete docker-compose.yml with monitoring services
- [x] Prometheus configuration file
- [x] Set of Grafana dashboards
- [x] Custom metrics implementations for services
- [x] Alert configuration in Prometheus

## Phase 2: API Validation and Testing

### Tasks

- [x] Create API validation script to test key endpoints
- [x] Create tests for blocks, transactions, and addresses endpoints
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
- [x] Diagnose internal server error on transaction queries
- [x] Create transaction debugging utility
- [x] Implement transaction API fixes for error handling and NULL values

### Deliverables

- [x] API validation script
- [x] Test suite for core endpoints
- [ ] CI/CD configuration
- [x] Transaction debug script
- [x] SQL script with transaction endpoint fixes

## Phase 3: Token Holder API Implementation

### Tasks

- [x] Design database schema for token holders
- [x] Create migration script to populate token holder data
- [x] Implement API endpoint to get token holders by token ID
- [x] Implement API endpoint to get top tokens by holder count
- [x] Implement API endpoint to get tokens owned by an address
- [x] Design triggers to update token balances in real-time
- [x] Add performance optimizations (indexes, query improvements)

### Deliverables

- [x] SQL schema for token holders and balances
- [x] API implementation for token holder endpoints
- [x] Token metadata extraction from transaction registers
- [x] Performance tuning and optimization

## Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment

### Tasks

- [x] Update README with new features and endpoints
- [x] Update API design document with token holder endpoints
- [x] Create API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI
- [ ] Create user guide for Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Perform load testing
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Deliverables

- [x] Updated README
- [x] API design documentation
- [x] Complete API documentation
- [ ] User guide for monitoring
- [ ] Deployment documentation
- [ ] Load testing results
