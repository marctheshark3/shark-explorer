# Shark Explorer Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

The Shark Explorer project enhances the Ergo blockchain explorer with improved monitoring capabilities, robust API functionality, and new token holder analytics features. This document summarizes the implementation work completed.

## Completed Features

### Monitoring Improvements

1. **Comprehensive Monitoring Infrastructure**
   - Added Prometheus and Grafana services to the stack
   - Configured PostgreSQL and Redis exporters
   - Created custom metrics for both API and indexer services

2. **Dashboards Suite**
   - Indexing Progress Dashboard: Tracks blockchain synchronization
   - Database Performance Dashboard: Monitors PostgreSQL metrics
   - API Performance Dashboard: Visualizes API usage and performance
   - Token Holders Dashboard: Displays token distribution statistics

3. **Alerting System**
   - Implemented alert rules for critical system conditions
   - Set up notifications for performance degradation
   - Created alerts for service availability monitoring

### API Improvements

1. **Transaction API Fixes**
   - Diagnosed and fixed internal server error on transaction endpoints
   - Implemented robust error handling and NULL value management
   - Added performance optimizations through proper indexing
   - Created a transaction debugging utility for troubleshooting

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Developed API validation scripts for core endpoints
   - Created token API validation tools
   - Implemented comprehensive test suite for verification

### New Token Holder Analytics

1. **Database Schema**
   - Designed efficient token balance tracking tables
   - Implemented real-time update triggers for token movements
   - Created indexes for performance optimization
   - Added token metadata extraction from transaction registers

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/tokens/{tokenId}/holders`: Lists token holders with balances
   - `/tokens/top`: Shows top tokens by holder count
   - `/tokens/address/{address}`: Displays tokens owned by an address
   - Added pagination support for all endpoints

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Optimized database queries for large datasets
   - Implemented efficient balance tracking logic
   - Added proper indexing for query performance
   - Designed for low-impact background processing

### Documentation

1. **Technical Documentation**
   - Updated README with new features and installation instructions
   - Created comprehensive API documentation
   - Updated implementation plan with progress tracking
   - Added database schema documentation

2. **User-Facing Documentation**
   - API endpoint documentation with examples
   - Response format specifications
   - Error handling documentation
   - Pagination guidance

## Technical Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI framework with PostgreSQL database
