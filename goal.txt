Goal: Set up a working Ergo Explorer instance that can sync with a local Ergo node

Requirements:
1. PostgreSQL database should be running and accessible to both services
2. Chain-grabber service should:
   - Connect to the Ergo node
   - Index blockchain data into PostgreSQL
   - Run on port 8081
3. Explorer-api service should:
   - Access the indexed data from PostgreSQL
   - Provide API endpoints for querying blockchain data
   - Run on port 8082
4. Both services should be able to:
   - Connect to the Ergo node at 192.168.1.195:9053
   - Maintain stable connections without timeouts
   - Process blockchain data efficiently

Current Status:
- PostgreSQL is running
- Services start but cannot connect to the Ergo node
- Node is accessible via curl from host machine
- Using host network mode for all containers
